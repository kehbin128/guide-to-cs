<img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKPwo4VdaeE/maxresdefault.jpg">Powerful and reliable, the AK-47 is one of the most popular assault rifles in the world (and in the game). 30 round magazine, rapid rate of fire, stunning percision and a high damage threshold.It can only be purchased by the Terrorist team and it is one of the quinnessential weapons for the Terrorist team in Counter Strike. It costs $2700 dollars and is highly regarded as one of the best weapons in the game.

                    <li>Giving away your position due to the noise.</li>
                    <li>Unecessary and may be caught off guard if your opponent catches you while you are reloading</li>
                    <li>Considered "nooby" because it is only 1 BULLET! You still have plenty of ammunition to go around, it's not the end of the world, only reload when it is safe and necessary!</li>

              <li>Spray Patterns
                  <ul>
                      <li>With this demonstration on the left wer can clearly see what the spray pattern is like when you are shooting an AK-47, round after round.</li>
                      <li>There are three main ways of using an AK-47, the first and obvious one would be spraying.</li>
                      <li>Spraying is only useful during close range engagements or multiple target engagements when there is no sufficient cover.</li>
                      <li>Burst firing is the next method, and since the first shot of the AK-47 is almost perfectly accurate, this is a more viable option for long-range targets/engagements but be aware that with spraying you will still have to deal with recoil. To truly use burst firing as an effective mechanism in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive you must utilize movement techniques like Sidestep shooting.</li>
                      <li>The most viable option for using the AK-47 at long distances and in general is tapping, where you have to aim directly at the head and tap at a smooth pace. Since the first shot is almost perfectly accurate it makes sense to utilize this method whenever the opportunity arises. On top of that, in CS:GO your aim resets very quickly so get some 1-tap headshots to display absolute dominance over your opponent</li>

            <li>Teams
                <ul>
                    <li>In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, there are two teams, the<span class=blue-text> Counter-Terrorist</span> team and the <span class=red-text>Terrorist team</span>.
                    <li>The main objective of the terrorists are to reek havoc upon the world and through dangerous bombing missions which require 5 men, one of whom is a bomb carrier who will plant the explosive in order to detonate at the desired location which will undoubtedly cause lots of chaos.

A reliable yet cheap but effective secondary rifle the Galil AR,
   <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/cswikia/images/6/66/Ak47go.png/revision/latest?cb=20130813201911">                                         but most importantly the terrorists are equipped with the most dangerous weapon in the game,<span class=red-text> the AK-47</span>, the weapon that strikes fear into the hearts of the so-called<span class=blue-text> "Guardians"</span>,<span class=red-text> 1 shot 1 kill</span>, erased with just one tap. Generally speaking, a lot of the terrorist weapons are much cheaper and more effective than the more expensive Counter Terrorism arsenal but when we get down to maps and strategies the Counter Terrorists always have the edge in a majority of situations.
                    <li>Now the Counter Terrorism Units, they are the world's guardians, the protectors that will be the first line of defense in any battlefield in this Global Offensive! Their primary objective is to basically counter terrorism. Pretty self explanatory if it means sacrificing themselves, these fierce warriors will stop at nothing to get the job done right even if it risks all of them dying. Sevare Vitas, to save lives, that is the motto that the Counter Terrorists live by. They too, alike the terrorists are equipped with a number of exclusive weapons. Starting off with the handguns the USP .45
                        <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/cswikia/images/3/3c/Csgousp.png/revision/latest?cb=20130813110903">, a percise and silent killing machine with it's attachable silencer which strikes the enemy without notice, no attention drawn. The next killer is the P2000 heckler & koch handgun,
                            <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/cswikia/images/4/4d/P2000go.png/revision/latest?cb=20130813194247"> effective armor penetration and undoubtedly terrific in close combat situations. Last but not the least, the Five-Seven,
              <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cswikia/images/8/8b/57go.png/revision/latest?cb=20130813194104">                  a 20 round magazine clip with an additional 5 magazines and you're in for a fun ride, this weapon can work at any distance and if used effectively can decimate waves of enemies rushing into bombsites, a handy tool for any defender or aggressor. Shot guns and smg's aren't just bad, but in my opinion pointless let's get on with the big boys, the rifles. The M4A4 Carbine,
              <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/cswikia/images/b/b5/M4a4.png/revision/latest?cb=20130813202347">            a 30 round mechanical beast, with a recoil and spray pattern similar to an AK-47 but much more unique, it is an un-silenced rifle that has a high rate of fire and is useful in any environment close range, mid range, long range, it excels with high proficiency.</li>

                      <li>The Next and most important weapon the CT's can equip is the M4A1-S, a silenced, yet dangerously accurate rifle that is capable of bringing the saying "Silent but deadly to life" it is one of my personal favorite assault rifles for the CT side in CS:GO and I adore it for it's raw power especially since it's silenced, the enemy won't know what hit them. Now, it is slightly inferior to the AK-47 and much more expensive than the terrorist rifle, it has a weird and janky spray pattern so some practice in controlling the recoil would be much needed before bringing this into the battlefield.</li>
